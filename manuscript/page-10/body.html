<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway.&nbsp; The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light.&nbsp; A vast silence reigned over the land.&nbsp; The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness.&nbsp; There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness&mdash;a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility.&nbsp; It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life.&nbsp; It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.</p></div> </div>
