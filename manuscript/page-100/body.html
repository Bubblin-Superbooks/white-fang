<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; They might have fought, but even wooing and its rivalry waited upon the more pressing hunger-need of the pack.</p><p>After each repulse, when the old wolf sheered abruptly away from the sharp-toothed object of his desire, he shouldered against a young three-year-old that ran on his blind right side.&nbsp; This young wolf had attained his full size; and, considering the weak and famished condition of the pack, he possessed more than the average vigour and spirit.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he ran with his head even with the shoulder of his one-eyed elder.&nbsp; When he ventured to run abreast of the older wolf (which was seldom), a snarl and a snap sent him back even with the shoulder again.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, he dropped cautiously and slowly behind and edged in between the old leader and the she-wolf.&nbsp; This was doubly resented, even triply resented.</p></div> </div>
