<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Occasionally a solitary male was driven out by the sharp teeth of his rivals.&nbsp; In the end there remained only four: the she-wolf, the young leader, the one-eyed one, and the ambitious three-year-old.</p><p>The she-wolf had by now developed a ferocious temper.&nbsp; Her three suitors all bore the marks of her teeth.&nbsp; Yet they never replied in kind, never defended themselves against her.&nbsp; They turned their shoulders to her most savage slashes, and with wagging tails and mincing steps strove to placate her wrath.&nbsp; But if they were all mildness toward her, they were all fierceness toward one another.&nbsp; The three-year-old grew too ambitious in his fierceness.&nbsp; He caught the one-eyed elder on his blind side and ripped his ear into ribbons.</p></div> </div>
