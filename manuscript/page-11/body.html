<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant.&nbsp; Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs.&nbsp; Their bristly fur was rimed with frost.&nbsp; Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost.&nbsp; Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind.&nbsp; The sled was without runners.&nbsp; It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow.&nbsp; The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it.&nbsp; On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and narrow oblong box.</p></div> </div>
