<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There were other things on the sled&mdash;blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.</p><p>In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man.&nbsp; At the rear of the sled toiled a second man.&nbsp; On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,&mdash;a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again.&nbsp; It is not the way of the Wild to like movement.&nbsp; Life is an offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement.&nbsp; It freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man&mdash;</p></div> </div>
