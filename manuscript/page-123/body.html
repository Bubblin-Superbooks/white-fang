<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For two days the she-wolf and One Eye hung about the Indian camp.&nbsp; He was worried and apprehensive, yet the camp lured his mate and she was loath to depart.&nbsp; But when, one morning, the air was rent with the report of a rifle close at hand, and a bullet smashed against a tree trunk several inches from One Eye&rsquo;s head, they hesitated no more, but went off on a long, swinging lope that put quick miles between them and the danger.</p><p>They did not go far&mdash;a couple of days&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; The she-wolf&rsquo;s need to find the thing for which she searched had now become imperative.&nbsp; She was getting very heavy, and could run but slowly.&nbsp; Once, in the pursuit of a rabbit, which she ordinarily would have caught with ease, she gave over and lay down and rested.</p></div> </div>
