<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>An hour went by, and a second hour.&nbsp; The pale light of the short sunless day was beginning to fade, when a faint far cry arose on the still air.&nbsp; It soared upward with a swift rush, till it reached its topmost note, where it persisted, palpitant and tense, and then slowly died away.&nbsp; It might have been a lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness.&nbsp; The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind.&nbsp; And then, across the narrow oblong box, each nodded to the other.</p><p>A second cry arose, piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness.&nbsp; Both men located the sound.&nbsp; It was to the rear, somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed.&nbsp; A third and answering cry arose, also to the rear and to the left of the second cry.</p></div> </div>
