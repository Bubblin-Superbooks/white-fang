<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In the first days after the birth of the cubs, One Eye had journeyed several times back to the Indian camp and robbed the rabbit snares; but, with the melting of the snow and the opening of the streams, the Indian camp had moved away, and that source of supply was closed to him.</p><p>When the grey cub came back to life and again took interest in the far white wall, he found that the population of his world had been reduced.&nbsp; Only one sister remained to him.&nbsp; The rest were gone.&nbsp; As he grew stronger, he found himself compelled to play alone, for the sister no longer lifted her head nor moved about.&nbsp; His little body rounded out with the meat he now ate; but the food had come too late for her.&nbsp; She slept continuously, a tiny skeleton flung round with skin in which the flame flickered lower and lower and at last went out.</p></div> </div>
