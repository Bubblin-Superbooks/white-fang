<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>So the grey cub knew fear, though he knew not the stuff of which fear was made.&nbsp; Possibly he accepted it as one of the restrictions of life.&nbsp; For he had already learned that there were such restrictions.&nbsp; Hunger he had known; and when he could not appease his hunger he had felt restriction.&nbsp; The hard obstruction of the cave-wall, the sharp nudge of his mother&rsquo;s nose, the smashing stroke of her paw, the hunger unappeased of several famines, had borne in upon him that all was not freedom in the world, that to life there was limitations and restraints.&nbsp; These limitations and restraints were laws.&nbsp; To be obedient to them was to escape hurt and make for happiness.</p></div> </div>
