<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A squirrel, running around the base of the trunk, came full upon him, and gave him a great fright.&nbsp; He cowered down and snarled.&nbsp; But the squirrel was as badly scared.&nbsp; It ran up the tree, and from a point of safety chattered back savagely.</p><p>This helped the cub&rsquo;s courage, and though the woodpecker he next encountered gave him a start, he proceeded confidently on his way.&nbsp; Such was his confidence, that when a moose-bird impudently hopped up to him, he reached out at it with a playful paw.&nbsp; The result was a sharp peck on the end of his nose that made him cower down and ki-yi.&nbsp; The noise he made was too much for the moose-bird, who sought safety in flight.</p></div> </div>
