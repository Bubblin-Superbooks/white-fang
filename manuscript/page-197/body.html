<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A full stomach conduces to inaction, and the cub lay in the cave, sleeping against his mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; He was aroused by her snarling.&nbsp; Never had he heard her snarl so terribly.&nbsp; Possibly in her whole life it was the most terrible snarl she ever gave.&nbsp; There was reason for it, and none knew it better than she.&nbsp; A lynx&rsquo;s lair is not despoiled with impunity.&nbsp; In the full glare of the afternoon light, crouching in the entrance of the cave, the cub saw the lynx-mother.&nbsp; The hair rippled up along his back at the sight.&nbsp; Here was fear, and it did not require his instinct to tell him of it.&nbsp; And if sight alone were not sufficient, the cry of rage the intruder gave, beginning with a snarl and rushing abruptly upward into a hoarse screech, was convincing enough in itself.</p></div> </div>
