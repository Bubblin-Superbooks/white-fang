<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Women and children were carrying more sticks and branches to Grey Beaver.&nbsp; It was evidently an affair of moment.&nbsp; White Fang came in until he touched Grey Beaver&rsquo;s knee, so curious was he, and already forgetful that this was a terrible man-animal.&nbsp; Suddenly he saw a strange thing like mist beginning to arise from the sticks and moss beneath Grey Beaver&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Then, amongst the sticks themselves, appeared a live thing, twisting and turning, of a colour like the colour of the sun in the sky.&nbsp; White Fang knew nothing about fire.&nbsp; It drew him as the light, in the mouth of the cave had drawn him in his early puppyhood.&nbsp; He crawled the several steps toward the flame.&nbsp; He heard Grey Beaver chuckle above him, and he knew the sound was not hostile.&nbsp; Then his nose touched the flame, and at the same instant his little tongue went out to it.</p></div> </div>
