<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Retreating before Lip-lip, White Fang made an indirect flight that led in and out and around the various tepees of the camp.&nbsp; He was a good runner, swifter than any puppy of his size, and swifter than Lip-lip.&nbsp; But he did not run his best in this chase.&nbsp; He barely held his own, one leap ahead of his pursuer.</p><p>Lip-lip, excited by the chase and by the persistent nearness of his victim, forgot caution and locality.&nbsp; When he remembered locality, it was too late.&nbsp; Dashing at top speed around a tepee, he ran full tilt into Kiche lying at the end of her stick.&nbsp; He gave one yelp of consternation, and then her punishing jaws closed upon him.&nbsp; She was tied, but he could not get away from her easily.&nbsp; She rolled him off his legs so that he could not run, while she repeatedly ripped and slashed him with her fangs.</p></div> </div>
