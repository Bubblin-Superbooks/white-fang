<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the Wild the time of a mother with her young is short; but under the dominion of man it is sometimes even shorter.&nbsp; Thus it was with White Fang.&nbsp; Grey Beaver was in the debt of Three Eagles.&nbsp; Three Eagles was going away on a trip up the Mackenzie to the Great Slave Lake.&nbsp; A strip of scarlet cloth, a bearskin, twenty cartridges, and Kiche, went to pay the debt.&nbsp; White Fang saw his mother taken aboard Three Eagles&rsquo; canoe, and tried to follow her.&nbsp; A blow from Three Eagles knocked him backward to the land.&nbsp; The canoe shoved off.&nbsp; He sprang into the water and swam after it, deaf to the sharp cries of Grey Beaver to return.&nbsp; Even a man-animal, a god, White Fang ignored, such was the terror he was in of losing his mother.</p></div> </div>
