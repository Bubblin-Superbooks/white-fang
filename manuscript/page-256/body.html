<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>That night, when all was still, White Fang remembered his mother and sorrowed for her.&nbsp; He sorrowed too loudly and woke up Grey Beaver, who beat him.&nbsp; After that he mourned gently when the gods were around.&nbsp; But sometimes, straying off to the edge of the woods by himself, he gave vent to his grief, and cried it out with loud whimperings and wailings.</p><p>It was during this period that he might have harkened to the memories of the lair and the stream and run back to the Wild.&nbsp; But the memory of his mother held him.&nbsp; As the hunting man-animals went out and came back, so she would come back to the village some time.&nbsp; So he remained in his bondage waiting for her.</p></div> </div>
