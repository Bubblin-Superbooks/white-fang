<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When dogs fight, there are usually preliminaries to the actual combat&mdash;snarlings and bristlings and stiff-legged struttings.&nbsp; But White Fang learned to omit these preliminaries.&nbsp; Delay meant the coming against him of all the young dogs.&nbsp; He must do his work quickly and get away.&nbsp; So he learnt to give no warning of his intention.&nbsp; He rushed in and snapped and slashed on the instant, without notice, before his foe could prepare to meet him.&nbsp; Thus he learned how to inflict quick and severe damage.&nbsp; Also he learned the value of surprise.&nbsp; A dog, taken off its guard, its shoulder slashed open or its ear ripped in ribbons before it knew what was happening, was a dog half whipped.</p></div> </div>
