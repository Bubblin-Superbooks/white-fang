<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A tree, contracting in the cool of the night, made a loud noise.&nbsp; It was directly above him.&nbsp; He yelped in his fright.&nbsp; A panic seized him, and he ran madly toward the village.&nbsp; He knew an overpowering desire for the protection and companionship of man.&nbsp; In his nostrils was the smell of the camp-smoke.&nbsp; In his ears the camp-sounds and cries were ringing loud.&nbsp; He passed out of the forest and into the moonlit open where were no shadows nor darknesses.&nbsp; But no village greeted his eyes.&nbsp; He had forgotten.&nbsp; The village had gone away.</p><p>His wild flight ceased abruptly.&nbsp; There was no place to which to flee.&nbsp; He slunk forlornly through the deserted camp, smelling the rubbish-heaps and the discarded rags and tags of the gods.</p></div> </div>
