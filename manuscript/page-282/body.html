<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Grey Beaver had intended camping that night on the far bank of the Mackenzie, for it was in that direction that the hunting lay.&nbsp; But on the near bank, shortly before dark, a moose coming down to drink, had been espied by Kloo-kooch, who was Grey Beaver&rsquo;s squaw.&nbsp; Now, had not the moose come down to drink, had not Mit-sah been steering out of the course because of the snow, had not Kloo-kooch sighted the moose, and had not Grey Beaver killed it with a lucky shot from his rifle, all subsequent things would have happened differently.&nbsp; Grey Beaver would not have camped on the near side of the Mackenzie, and White Fang would have passed by and gone on, either to die or to find his way to his wild brothers and become one of them&mdash;a wolf to the end of his days.</p></div> </div>
