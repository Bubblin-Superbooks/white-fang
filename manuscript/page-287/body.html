<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When December was well along, Grey Beaver went on a journey up the Mackenzie.&nbsp; Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch went with him.&nbsp; One sled he drove himself, drawn by dogs he had traded for or borrowed.&nbsp; A second and smaller sled was driven by Mit-sah, and to this was harnessed a team of puppies.&nbsp; It was more of a toy affair than anything else, yet it was the delight of Mit-sah, who felt that he was beginning to do a man&rsquo;s work in the world.&nbsp; Also, he was learning to drive dogs and to train dogs; while the puppies themselves were being broken in to the harness.&nbsp; Furthermore, the sled was of some service, for it carried nearly two hundred pounds of outfit and food.</p></div> </div>
