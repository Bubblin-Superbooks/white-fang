<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>White Fang had seen the camp-dogs toiling in the harness, so that he did not resent overmuch the first placing of the harness upon himself.&nbsp; About his neck was put a moss-stuffed collar, which was connected by two pulling-traces to a strap that passed around his chest and over his back.&nbsp; It was to this that was fastened the long rope by which he pulled at the sled.</p><p>There were seven puppies in the team.&nbsp; The others had been born earlier in the year and were nine and ten months old, while White Fang was only eight months old.&nbsp; Each dog was fastened to the sled by a single rope.&nbsp; No two ropes were of the same length, while the difference in length between any two ropes was at least that of a dog&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Every rope was brought to a ring at the front end of the sled.</p></div> </div>
