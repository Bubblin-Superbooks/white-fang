<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The sled itself was without runners, being a birch-bark toboggan, with upturned forward end to keep it from ploughing under the snow.&nbsp; This construction enabled the weight of the sled and load to be distributed over the largest snow-surface; for the snow was crystal-powder and very soft.&nbsp; Observing the same principle of widest distribution of weight, the dogs at the ends of their ropes radiated fan-fashion from the nose of the sled, so that no dog trod in another&rsquo;s footsteps.</p><p>There was, furthermore, another virtue in the fan-formation.&nbsp; The ropes of varying length prevented the dogs attacking from the rear those that ran in front of them.&nbsp; For a dog to attack another, it would have to turn upon one at a shorter rope.</p></div> </div>
