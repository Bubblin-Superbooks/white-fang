<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Before the day was out, White Fang was to learn more about this law.&nbsp; Mit-sah, alone, gathering firewood in the forest, encountered the boy that had been bitten.&nbsp; With him were other boys.&nbsp; Hot words passed.&nbsp; Then all the boys attacked Mit-sah.&nbsp; It was going hard with him.&nbsp; Blows were raining upon him from all sides.&nbsp; White Fang looked on at first.&nbsp; This was an affair of the gods, and no concern of his.&nbsp; Then he realised that this was Mit-sah, one of his own particular gods, who was being maltreated.&nbsp; It was no reasoned impulse that made White Fang do what he then did.&nbsp; A mad rush of anger sent him leaping in amongst the combatants.&nbsp; Five minutes later the landscape was covered with fleeing boys, many of whom dripped blood upon the snow in token that White Fang&rsquo;s teeth had not been idle.</p></div> </div>
