<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; When Mit-sah told the story in camp, Grey Beaver ordered meat to be given to White Fang.&nbsp; He ordered much meat to be given, and White Fang, gorged and sleepy by the fire, knew that the law had received its verification.</p><p>It was in line with these experiences that White Fang came to learn the law of property and the duty of the defence of property.&nbsp; From the protection of his god&rsquo;s body to the protection of his god&rsquo;s possessions was a step, and this step he made.&nbsp; What was his god&rsquo;s was to be defended against all the world&mdash;even to the extent of biting other gods.&nbsp; Not only was such an act sacrilegious in its nature, but it was fraught with peril.&nbsp; The gods were all-powerful, and a dog was no match against them; yet White Fang learned to face them, fiercely belligerent and unafraid.&nbsp; Duty rose above fear, and thieving gods learned to leave Grey Beaver&rsquo;s property alone.</p></div> </div>
