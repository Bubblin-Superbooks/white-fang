<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One thing, in this connection, White Fang quickly learnt, and that was that a thieving god was usually a cowardly god and prone to run away at the sounding of the alarm.&nbsp; Also, he learned that but brief time elapsed between his sounding of the alarm and Grey Beaver coming to his aid.&nbsp; He came to know that it was not fear of him that drove the thief away, but fear of Grey Beaver.&nbsp; White Fang did not give the alarm by barking.&nbsp; He never barked.&nbsp; His method was to drive straight at the intruder, and to sink his teeth in if he could.&nbsp; Because he was morose and solitary, having nothing to do with the other dogs, he was unusually fitted to guard his master&rsquo;s property; and in this he was encouraged and trained by Grey Beaver.&nbsp; One result of this was to make White Fang more ferocious and indomitable, and more solitary.</p></div> </div>
