<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The months went by, binding stronger and stronger the covenant between dog and man.&nbsp; This was the ancient covenant that the first wolf that came in from the Wild entered into with man.&nbsp; And, like all succeeding wolves and wild dogs that had done likewise, White Fang worked the covenant out for himself.&nbsp; The terms were simple.&nbsp; For the possession of a flesh-and-blood god, he exchanged his own liberty.&nbsp; Food and fire, protection and companionship, were some of the things he received from the god.&nbsp; In return, he guarded the god&rsquo;s property, defended his body, worked for him, and obeyed him.</p><p>The possession of a god implies service.&nbsp; White Fang&rsquo;s was a service of duty and awe, but not of love.&nbsp; He did not know what love was.&nbsp; He had no experience of love.&nbsp; Kiche was a remote memory.</p></div> </div>
