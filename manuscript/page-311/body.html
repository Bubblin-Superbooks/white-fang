<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The spring of the year was at hand when Grey Beaver finished his long journey.&nbsp; It was April, and White Fang was a year old when he pulled into the home villages and was loosed from the harness by Mit-sah.&nbsp; Though a long way from his full growth, White Fang, next to Lip-lip, was the largest yearling in the village.&nbsp; Both from his father, the wolf, and from Kiche, he had inherited stature and strength, and already he was measuring up alongside the full-grown dogs.&nbsp; But he had not yet grown compact.&nbsp; His body was slender and rangy, and his strength more stringy than massive, His coat was the true wolf-grey, and to all appearances he was true wolf himself.&nbsp; The quarter-strain of dog he had inherited from Kiche had left no mark on him physically, though it had played its part in his mental make-up.</p></div> </div>
