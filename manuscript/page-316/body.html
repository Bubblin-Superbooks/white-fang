<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This was too much for White Fang.&nbsp; Fresh upon his months of mastery over his own team-mates, it was beyond his self-control to stand idly by while another devoured the meat that belonged to him.&nbsp; He struck, after his custom, without warning.&nbsp; With the first slash, Baseek&rsquo;s right ear was ripped into ribbons.&nbsp; He was astounded at the suddenness of it.&nbsp; But more things, and most grievous ones, were happening with equal suddenness.&nbsp; He was knocked off his feet.&nbsp; His throat was bitten.&nbsp; While he was struggling to his feet the young dog sank teeth twice into his shoulder.&nbsp; The swiftness of it was bewildering.&nbsp; He made a futile rush at White Fang, clipping the empty air with an outraged snap.&nbsp; The next moment his nose was laid open, and he was staggering backward away from the meat.</p></div> </div>
