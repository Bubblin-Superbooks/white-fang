<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There was wailing in the village, where the women and children went without in order that what little they had might go into the bellies of the lean and hollow-eyed hunters who trod the forest in the vain pursuit of meat.</p><p>To such extremity were the gods driven that they ate the soft-tanned leather of their mocassins and mittens, while the dogs ate the harnesses off their backs and the very whip-lashes.&nbsp; Also, the dogs ate one another, and also the gods ate the dogs.&nbsp; The weakest and the more worthless were eaten first.&nbsp; The dogs that still lived, looked on and understood.&nbsp; A few of the boldest and wisest forsook the fires of the gods, which had now become a shambles, and fled into the forest, where, in the end, they starved to death or were eaten by wolves.</p></div> </div>
