<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One day While Fang encountered a young wolf, gaunt and scrawny, loose-jointed with famine.&nbsp; Had he not been hungry himself, White Fang might have gone with him and eventually found his way into the pack amongst his wild brethren.&nbsp; As it was, he ran the young wolf down and killed and ate him.</p><p>Fortune seemed to favour him.&nbsp; Always, when hardest pressed for food, he found something to kill.&nbsp; Again, when he was weak, it was his luck that none of the larger preying animals chanced upon him.&nbsp; Thus, he was strong from the two days&rsquo; eating a lynx had afforded him when the hungry wolf-pack ran full tilt upon him.&nbsp; It was a long, cruel chase, but he was better nourished than they, and in the end outran them.&nbsp; And not only did he outrun them, but, circling widely back on his track, he gathered in one of his exhausted pursuers.</p></div> </div>
