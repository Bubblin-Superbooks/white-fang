<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One cannot violate the promptings of one&rsquo;s nature without having that nature recoil upon itself.&nbsp; Such a recoil is like that of a hair, made to grow out from the body, turning unnaturally upon the direction of its growth and growing into the body&mdash;a rankling, festering thing of hurt.&nbsp; And so with White Fang.&nbsp; Every urge of his being impelled him to spring upon the pack that cried at his heels, but it was the will of the gods that this should not be; and behind the will, to enforce it, was the whip of cariboo-gut with its biting thirty-foot lash.&nbsp; So White Fang could only eat his heart in bitterness and develop a hatred and malice commensurate with the ferocity and indomitability of his nature.</p></div> </div>
