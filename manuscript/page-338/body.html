<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If ever a creature was the enemy of its kind, White Fang was that creature.&nbsp; He asked no quarter, gave none.&nbsp; He was continually marred and scarred by the teeth of the pack, and as continually he left his own marks upon the pack.&nbsp; Unlike most leaders, who, when camp was made and the dogs were unhitched, huddled near to the gods for protection, White Fang disdained such protection.&nbsp; He walked boldly about the camp, inflicting punishment in the night for what he had suffered in the day.&nbsp; In the time before he was made leader of the team, the pack had learned to get out of his way.&nbsp; But now it was different.&nbsp; Excited by the day-long pursuit of him, swayed subconsciously by the insistent iteration on their brains of the sight of him fleeing away, mastered by the feeling of mastery enjoyed all day, the dogs could not bring themselves to give way to him.</p></div> </div>
