<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was at Fort Yukon that White Fang saw his first white men.&nbsp; As compared with the Indians he had known, they were to him another race of beings, a race of superior gods.&nbsp; They impressed him as possessing superior power, and it is on power that godhead rests.&nbsp; White Fang did not reason it out, did not in his mind make the sharp generalisation that the white gods were more powerful.&nbsp; It was a feeling, nothing more, and yet none the less potent.&nbsp; As, in his puppyhood, the looming bulks of the tepees, man-reared, had affected him as manifestations of power, so was he affected now by the houses and the huge fort all of massive logs.&nbsp; Here was power.&nbsp; Those white gods were strong.&nbsp; They possessed greater mastery over matter than the gods he had known, most powerful among which was Grey Beaver.&nbsp; And yet Grey Beaver was as a child-god among these white-skinned ones.</p></div> </div>
