<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A small number of white men lived in Fort Yukon.&nbsp; These men had been long in the country.&nbsp; They called themselves Sour-doughs, and took great pride in so classifying themselves.&nbsp; For other men, new in the land, they felt nothing but disdain.&nbsp; The men who came ashore from the steamers were newcomers.&nbsp; They were known as chechaquos, and they always wilted at the application of the name.&nbsp; They made their bread with baking-powder.&nbsp; This was the invidious distinction between them and the Sour-doughs, who, forsooth, made their bread from sour-dough because they had no baking-powder.</p><p>All of which is neither here nor there.&nbsp; The men in the fort disdained the newcomers and enjoyed seeing them come to grief.&nbsp; Especially did they enjoy the havoc worked amongst the newcomers&rsquo; dogs by White Fang and his disreputable gang.</p></div> </div>
