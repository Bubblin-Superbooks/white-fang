<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; When a steamer arrived, the men of the fort made it a point always to come down to the bank and see the fun.&nbsp; They looked forward to it with as much anticipation as did the Indian dogs, while they were not slow to appreciate the savage and crafty part played by White Fang.</p><p>But there was one man amongst them who particularly enjoyed the sport.&nbsp; He would come running at the first sound of a steamboat&rsquo;s whistle; and when the last fight was over and White Fang and the pack had scattered, he would return slowly to the fort, his face heavy with regret.&nbsp; Sometimes, when a soft southland dog went down, shrieking its death-cry under the fangs of the pack, this man would be unable to contain himself, and would leap into the air and cry out with delight.&nbsp; And always he had a sharp and covetous eye for White Fang.</p></div> </div>
