<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With the simpler creatures, good and bad are things simply understood.&nbsp; The good stands for all things that bring easement and satisfaction and surcease from pain.&nbsp; Therefore, the good is liked.&nbsp; The bad stands for all things that are fraught with discomfort, menace, and hurt, and is hated accordingly.&nbsp; White Fang&rsquo;s feel of Beauty Smith was bad.&nbsp; From the man&rsquo;s distorted body and twisted mind, in occult ways, like mists rising from malarial marshes, came emanations of the unhealth within.&nbsp; Not by reasoning, not by the five senses alone, but by other and remoter and uncharted senses, came the feeling to White Fang that the man was ominous with evil, pregnant with hurtfulness, and therefore a thing bad, and wisely to be hated.</p></div> </div>
