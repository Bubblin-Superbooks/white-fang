<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>White Fang was in Grey Beaver&rsquo;s camp when Beauty Smith first visited it.&nbsp; At the faint sound of his distant feet, before he came in sight, White Fang knew who was coming and began to bristle.&nbsp; He had been lying down in an abandon of comfort, but he arose quickly, and, as the man arrived, slid away in true wolf-fashion to the edge of the camp.&nbsp; He did not know what they said, but he could see the man and Grey Beaver talking together.&nbsp; Once, the man pointed at him, and White Fang snarled back as though the hand were just descending upon him instead of being, as it was, fifty feet away.&nbsp; The man laughed at this; and White Fang slunk away to the sheltering woods, his head turned to observe as he glided softly over the ground.</p></div> </div>
