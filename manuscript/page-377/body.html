<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Beauty Smith enjoyed the task.&nbsp; He delighted in it.&nbsp; He gloated over his victim, and his eyes flamed dully, as he swung the whip or club and listened to White Fang&rsquo;s cries of pain and to his helpless bellows and snarls.&nbsp; For Beauty Smith was cruel in the way that cowards are cruel.&nbsp; Cringing and snivelling himself before the blows or angry speech of a man, he revenged himself, in turn, upon creatures weaker than he.&nbsp; All life likes power, and Beauty Smith was no exception.&nbsp; Denied the expression of power amongst his own kind, he fell back upon the lesser creatures and there vindicated the life that was in him.&nbsp; But Beauty Smith had not created himself, and no blame was to be attached to him.&nbsp; He had come into the world with a twisted body and a brute intelligence.&nbsp; This had constituted the clay of him, and it had not been kindly moulded by the world.</p></div> </div>
