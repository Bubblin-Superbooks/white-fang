<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>White Fang ceased only when he had tired himself out.&nbsp; He could do nothing, and he could not understand.&nbsp; Never, in all his fighting, had this thing happened.&nbsp; The dogs he had fought with did not fight that way.&nbsp; With them it was snap and slash and get away, snap and slash and get away.&nbsp; He lay partly on his side, panting for breath.&nbsp; Cherokee still holding his grip, urged against him, trying to get him over entirely on his side.&nbsp; White Fang resisted, and he could feel the jaws shifting their grip, slightly relaxing and coming together again in a chewing movement.&nbsp; Each shift brought the grip closer to his throat.&nbsp; The bull-dog&rsquo;s method was to hold what he had, and when opportunity favoured to work in for more.&nbsp; Opportunity favoured when White Fang remained quiet.&nbsp; When White Fang struggled, Cherokee was content merely to hold on.</p></div> </div>
