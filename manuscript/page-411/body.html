<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The bulging back of Cherokee&rsquo;s neck was the only portion of his body that White Fang&rsquo;s teeth could reach.&nbsp; He got hold toward the base where the neck comes out from the shoulders; but he did not know the chewing method of fighting, nor were his jaws adapted to it.&nbsp; He spasmodically ripped and tore with his fangs for a space.&nbsp; Then a change in their position diverted him.&nbsp; The bull-dog had managed to roll him over on his back, and still hanging on to his throat, was on top of him.&nbsp; Like a cat, White Fang bowed his hind-quarters in, and, with the feet digging into his enemy&rsquo;s abdomen above him, he began to claw with long tearing-strokes.&nbsp; Cherokee might well have been disembowelled had he not quickly pivoted on his grip and got his body off of White Fang&rsquo;s and at right angles to it.</p></div> </div>
