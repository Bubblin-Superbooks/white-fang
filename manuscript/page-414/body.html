<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Round and round and back again, stumbling and falling and rising, even uprearing at times on his hind-legs and lifting his foe clear of the earth, he struggled vainly to shake off the clinging death.</p><p>At last he fell, toppling backward, exhausted; and the bull-dog promptly shifted his grip, getting in closer, mangling more and more of the fur-folded flesh, throttling White Fang more severely than ever.&nbsp; Shouts of applause went up for the victor, and there were many cries of &ldquo;Cherokee!&rdquo; &ldquo;Cherokee!&rdquo;&nbsp; To this Cherokee responded by vigorous wagging of the stump of his tail.&nbsp; But the clamour of approval did not distract him.&nbsp; There was no sympathetic relation between his tail and his massive jaws.&nbsp; The one might wag, but the others held their terrible grip on White Fang&rsquo;s throat.</p></div> </div>
