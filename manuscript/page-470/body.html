<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But White Fang was not demonstrative.&nbsp; He was too old, too firmly moulded, to become adept at expressing himself in new ways.&nbsp; He was too self-possessed, too strongly poised in his own isolation.&nbsp; Too long had he cultivated reticence, aloofness, and moroseness.&nbsp; He had never barked in his life, and he could not now learn to bark a welcome when his god approached.&nbsp; He was never in the way, never extravagant nor foolish in the expression of his love.&nbsp; He never ran to meet his god.&nbsp; He waited at a distance; but he always waited, was always there.&nbsp; His love partook of the nature of worship, dumb, inarticulate, a silent adoration.&nbsp; Only by the steady regard of his eyes did he express his love, and by the unceasing following with his eyes of his god&rsquo;s every movement.</p></div> </div>
