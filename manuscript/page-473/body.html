<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Different from the Mackenzie toboggans were the Klondike sleds with runners under them.&nbsp; And different was the method of driving the dogs.&nbsp; There was no fan-formation of the team.&nbsp; The dogs worked in single file, one behind another, hauling on double traces.&nbsp; And here, in the Klondike, the leader was indeed the leader.&nbsp; The wisest as well as strongest dog was the leader, and the team obeyed him and feared him.&nbsp; That White Fang should quickly gain this post was inevitable.&nbsp; He could not be satisfied with less, as Matt learned after much inconvenience and trouble.&nbsp; White Fang picked out the post for himself, and Matt backed his judgment with strong language after the experiment had been tried.&nbsp; But, though he worked in the sled in the day, White Fang did not forego the guarding of his master&rsquo;s property in the night.</p></div> </div>
