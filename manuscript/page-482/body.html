<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Having learned to snuggle, White Fang was guilty of it often.&nbsp; It was the final word.&nbsp; He could not go beyond it.&nbsp; The one thing of which he had always been particularly jealous was his head.&nbsp; He had always disliked to have it touched.&nbsp; It was the Wild in him, the fear of hurt and of the trap, that had given rise to the panicky impulses to avoid contacts.&nbsp; It was the mandate of his instinct that that head must be free.&nbsp; And now, with the love-master, his snuggling was the deliberate act of putting himself into a position of hopeless helplessness.&nbsp; It was an expression of perfect confidence, of absolute self-surrender, as though he said: &ldquo;I put myself into thy hands.&nbsp; Work thou thy will with me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
