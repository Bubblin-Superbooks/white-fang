<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One night, not long after the return, Scott and Matt sat at a game of cribbage preliminary to going to bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifteen-two, fifteen-four an&rsquo; a pair makes six,&rdquo; Mat was pegging up, when there was an outcry and sound of snarling without.&nbsp; They looked at each other as they started to rise to their feet.</p><p>&ldquo;The wolf&rsquo;s nailed somebody,&rdquo; Matt said.</p><p>A wild scream of fear and anguish hastened them.</p><p>&ldquo;Bring a light!&rdquo; Scott shouted, as he sprang outside.</p><p>Matt followed with the lamp, and by its light they saw a man lying on his back in the snow.&nbsp; His arms were folded, one above the other, across his face and throat.&nbsp; Thus he was trying to shield himself from White Fang&rsquo;s teeth.&nbsp; And there was need for it.&nbsp; White Fang was in a rage, wickedly making his attack on the most vulnerable spot.</p></div> </div>
