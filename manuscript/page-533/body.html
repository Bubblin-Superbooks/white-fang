<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>White Fang allowed all the members of the family to pet him and make much of him; but he never gave to them what he gave to the master.&nbsp; No caress of theirs could put the love-croon into his throat, and, try as they would, they could never persuade him into snuggling against them.&nbsp; This expression of abandon and surrender, of absolute trust, he reserved for the master alone.&nbsp; In fact, he never regarded the members of the family in any other light than possessions of the love-master.</p><p>Also White Fang had early come to differentiate between the family and the servants of the household.&nbsp; The latter were afraid of him, while he merely refrained from attacking them.&nbsp; This because he considered that they were likewise possessions of the master.&nbsp; Between White Fang and them existed a neutrality and no more.</p></div> </div>
