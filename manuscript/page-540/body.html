<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the morning, when the master came out on to the porch, fifty white Leghorn hens, laid out in a row by the groom, greeted his eyes.&nbsp; He whistled to himself, softly, first with surprise, and then, at the end, with admiration.&nbsp; His eyes were likewise greeted by White Fang, but about the latter there were no signs of shame nor guilt.&nbsp; He carried himself with pride, as though, forsooth, he had achieved a deed praiseworthy and meritorious.&nbsp; There was about him no consciousness of sin.&nbsp; The master&rsquo;s lips tightened as he faced the disagreeable task.&nbsp; Then he talked harshly to the unwitting culprit, and in his voice there was nothing but godlike wrath.&nbsp; Also, he held White Fang&rsquo;s nose down to the slain hens, and at the same time cuffed him soundly.</p></div> </div>
