<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>White Fang never raided a chicken-roost again.&nbsp; It was against the law, and he had learned it.&nbsp; Then the master took him into the chicken-yards.&nbsp; White Fang&rsquo;s natural impulse, when he saw the live food fluttering about him and under his very nose, was to spring upon it.&nbsp; He obeyed the impulse, but was checked by the master&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; They continued in the yards for half an hour.&nbsp; Time and again the impulse surged over White Fang, and each time, as he yielded to it, he was checked by the master&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; Thus it was he learned the law, and ere he left the domain of the chickens, he had learned to ignore their existence.</p></div> </div>
