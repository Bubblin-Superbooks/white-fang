<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There were butcher-shops where meat hung within reach.&nbsp; This meat he must not touch.&nbsp; There were cats at the houses the master visited that must be let alone.&nbsp; And there were dogs everywhere that snarled at him and that he must not attack.&nbsp; And then, on the crowded sidewalks there were persons innumerable whose attention he attracted.&nbsp; They would stop and look at him, point him out to one another, examine him, talk of him, and, worst of all, pat him.&nbsp; And these perilous contacts from all these strange hands he must endure.&nbsp; Yet this endurance he achieved.&nbsp; Furthermore, he got over being awkward and self-conscious.&nbsp; In a lofty way he received the attentions of the multitudes of strange gods.&nbsp; With condescension he accepted their condescension.&nbsp; On the other hand, there was something about him that prevented great familiarity.&nbsp; They patted him on the head and passed on, contented and pleased with their own daring.</p></div> </div>
