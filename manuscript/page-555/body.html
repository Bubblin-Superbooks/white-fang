<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But there was one trial in White Fang&rsquo;s life&mdash;Collie.&nbsp; She never gave him a moment&rsquo;s peace.&nbsp; She was not so amenable to the law as he.&nbsp; She defied all efforts of the master to make her become friends with White Fang.&nbsp; Ever in his ears was sounding her sharp and nervous snarl.&nbsp; She had never forgiven him the chicken-killing episode, and persistently held to the belief that his intentions were bad.&nbsp; She found him guilty before the act, and treated him accordingly.&nbsp; She became a pest to him, like a policeman following him around the stable and the hounds, and, if he even so much as glanced curiously at a pigeon or chicken, bursting into an outcry of indignation and wrath.&nbsp; His favourite way of ignoring her was to lie down, with his head on his fore-paws, and pretend sleep.&nbsp; This always dumfounded and silenced her.</p></div> </div>
