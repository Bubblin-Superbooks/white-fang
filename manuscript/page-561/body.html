<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The first time occurred when the master was trying to teach a spirited thoroughbred the method of opening and closing gates without the rider&rsquo;s dismounting.&nbsp; Time and again and many times he ranged the horse up to the gate in the effort to close it and each time the horse became frightened and backed and plunged away.&nbsp; It grew more nervous and excited every moment.&nbsp; When it reared, the master put the spurs to it and made it drop its fore-legs back to earth, whereupon it would begin kicking with its hind-legs.&nbsp; White Fang watched the performance with increasing anxiety until he could contain himself no longer, when he sprang in front of the horse and barked savagely and warningly.</p><p>Though he often tried to bark thereafter, and the master encouraged him, he succeeded only once, and then it was not in the master&rsquo;s presence.</p></div> </div>
