<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Judge Scott did not know all things, and he did not know that he was party to a police conspiracy, that the evidence was hatched and perjured, that Jim Hall was guiltless of the crime charged.&nbsp; And Jim Hall, on the other hand, did not know that Judge Scott was merely ignorant.&nbsp; Jim Hall believed that the judge knew all about it and was hand in glove with the police in the perpetration of the monstrous injustice.&nbsp; So it was, when the doom of fifty years of living death was uttered by Judge Scott, that Jim Hall, hating all things in the society that misused him, rose up and raged in the court-room until dragged down by half a dozen of his blue-coated enemies.&nbsp; To him, Judge Scott was the keystone in the arch of injustice, and upon Judge Scott he emptied the vials of his wrath and hurled the threats of his revenge yet to come.&nbsp; Then Jim Hall went to his living death . . . and escaped.</p></div> </div>
