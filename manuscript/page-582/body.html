<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In the midst of the wreckage of overthrown and smashed furniture, partly on his side, his face hidden by an arm, lay a man.&nbsp; Weedon Scott bent over, removed the arm and turned the man&rsquo;s face upward.&nbsp; A gaping throat explained the manner of his death.</p><p>&ldquo;Jim Hall,&rdquo; said Judge Scott, and father and son looked significantly at each other.</p><p>Then they turned to White Fang.&nbsp; He, too, was lying on his side.&nbsp; His eyes were closed, but the lids slightly lifted in an effort to look at them as they bent over him, and the tail was perceptibly agitated in a vain effort to wag.&nbsp; Weedon Scott patted him, and his throat rumbled an acknowledging growl.&nbsp; But it was a weak growl at best, and it quickly ceased.&nbsp; His eyelids drooped and went shut, and his whole body seemed to relax and flatten out upon the floor.</p></div> </div>
